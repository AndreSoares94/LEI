## So, what is this?
Webpage where medical staff can log in and create prescriptions for patients that are registed. The database (MongoDB) has over 100.000 examples of medicines that the doctor can choose to create a prescription, each of them is affiliated with the correct way
of taking the medicine and potential bad pairings with other meds. When two imcompatible meds are chosen the doctor is warned.
